Senior Project CIS 598

This project is a web application using Django and the YouTube API to search for Super Smash Bros.
Melee matches using a set of filters.

Installed: Django, requests, isodate

To run the project, navigate to the top youtubesearch folder in the command prompt and run 
'python manage.py runserver'. This will start the server and allow you to access the application
based on the IP given in the console.
Must be run from the same folder as manage.py.

Using the different filters for characters, tournament, players, pressing Search will load the top 9 results and
allow you to watch.
